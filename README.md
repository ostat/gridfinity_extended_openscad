# Gridfinity Extended OpenSCAD Model

Welcome to the Gridfinity Extended OpenSCAD project! This is a recreation of Zack Freedman's Gridfinity system in OpenSCAD, designed to accurately reproduce the original Gridfinity bins while adding extra features and customization options.

## Features
- Accurate reproduction of Zack Freedman's original Gridfinity bins.
- Additional features and customization options for the base model.
- Extension patterns for further personalization and modularity.

## Getting Started
**Gridfinity Extended** is a set of OpenSCAD scripts for generating gridfinity related 3d models. There are two main ways to use the scripts. 
- There is the official online customiser hosted at [makerworld](https://makerworld.com/en/models/481168-gridfinity-extended#profileId-1037829). 
- Alternatively you can download and run the scripts locally.

### Option 1: Online customiser
You can also use the online version of this project hosted on [MakerWorld](https://makerworld.com). This option allows you to quickly experiment with the models without downloading anything. 
The scripts uploaded to are fully featured and supported. I keep these updated with the latest version from GitHub.<br>

### Option 2: Running locally
Running locally is how I recommend running the scripts. The scripts run faster and you can save your configuration. However but it does require you download and install the OpenSCAD software on your local machine.

1. Install OpenSCAD. This project relies on features available in the **OpenSCAD Developer Version**. Make sure to download it from [OpenSCAD Developer Version](https://openscad.org/downloads.html#snapshots).

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ostat/gridfinity-extended-openscad.git
   ```
   Alternatively, you can download the ZIP file from the repository page and extract it.

2. Open the project files in OpenSCAD. **Note:** You must use the developer version of OpenSCAD for this project. Download it here: [OpenSCAD Developer Version](https://openscad.org/downloads.html#snapshots).

3. Start exploring and customising the Gridfinity bins and extensions!
